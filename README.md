# GraphingWordPaths

This program takes in a text file of words as a "dictionary". We have some test cases that we will check to see if we can get from one word to another. If we can then we will print out the words that we used from the dictionary to get to the other word (We can only change one letter at a time when we are moving from word to word). Makes use of graphs/BFS algorithm to find the shortest path to a word.
